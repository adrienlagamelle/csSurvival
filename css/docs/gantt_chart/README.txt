I. Team's management structure and processes
--------------------------------------------
A. Tools:
1. Slack
We create a group using Slack for communication purpose. We use Slack to
post each group member's progress, questions, and testing results. We 
also use Slack to schedule group meetings.
2. GitLab
We use GitLab to work on the project spontaneously. Each group member will 
merge their codes into the branch and push their codes to the master branch.
Each group member can get the newest version of the project easily and we
can work on the same codes at the same time.

B. Meetings:
Meetings are used to discuss to assign tasks to each group member and to
decide how each required functionality works and the way of implementing
each functionality.

C. Communication Strategies:
We combine Slack and meetings to communicate. Usually we will use slack to
address questions and share updates, unless any group member wants to discuss
decisions that need to be made by the whole group and implementation of 
certain features which we will schedule a meeting before the lecture begins.



II. Team work assignments with reference to the gantt chart
-----------------------------------------------------------
A. Documentations:
1. Project management plan including the gantt chart
First lay out all the tasks that need to be done and each group member will
choose tasks during the first group meeting.
2. Use Cases and User stories
This will lead to get requirement gathering document.
3. Requirement gathering document
Each group memebr will include the functions to their tasks according to the 
requirements.
4. UML diagrams
Narrow the requirement to high level design of classes and functions inside 
each module and the whole program.
5. Documents for each functional features
Each group member will document their functional feature tasks after they 
finish their implementations.
6. Project review from the developer perspective
This will be done after the whole project to summerize the issues related to
the project.
7. Final project management plan including individual rankings
This will be done after the whole project to rate each group member's 
performance based on several factors.

B.Development and Implementation of the functionalities:
Each group member will be assigned to do one of or two of the functional 
features and one of the group member will implement the database. After each 
one finishs their implementation, each will merge their updates into the 
master branch to create the whole project.

C. Implementation of usability:
We will include both English and French versions of the site to make the site
more usable.

D. Design:
Group members will modify the looks of the site to make it look better.

E. Testing suites:
Each group member will implement test units after they finish implementing 
their assigned module.



III. Plan and actual activity compared using gantt
--------------------------------------------------
A. Communication:
1. Meetings took place during the scheduled the time in gantt chart, but the contents
of each meeting were decided before each meeting time.
2. We used slack as our communication tool as planned in gantt chart.

B. Development and Implementation of the functionalities:
1. Most of the tasks that were done following the planned tasks in gantt chart, however, 
some tasks or modules took longer time than expected and finished later than planned.
2. We used GitLab to collect our codes as planned in the gantt chart.

C. Implementation of usability:
1. The implementation and result of bilingual version of the site did not go as planned and
this task took longer than planned in the gantt chart.
2. We used GitLab to collect the codes as planned in the gantt chart.

D. Documentation:
1. Most tasks were done following the planned tasks in gantt chart, however, some documentations
that should be done before the start of the project are done after the project started.
2. We used GitLab to collect our documentations as planned in the gantt chart.

E. Testing suites:
1. Tasks were done following the planned tasks in the gantt chart, however, we started and 
finished the test units after we almost finished the whole project instead of after each 
member finished their own modules.
2. We used GitLab to collect our documentations as planned in the gantt chart.

F. Design:
1. Tasks were done following the planned tasks with corresponding time estimations in the 
gantt chart.
2. We used GitLab to collect our documentations as planned in the gantt chart.



IV. Deliverables for each team member's individual credit.
