 <h1> Development Overview </h1>
 <h2> Introduction: </h2>
 <p> Throughout the project we have be able to learn through first hand experience the process of software development and deployment and because of it we have
 gained valuable knowledge of the computing industry.  Over the course of developing the webpage there have been several setbacks and learning opportunities but
 in the end the webpage was completed, and all required features were implemented.  Because of this the project is therefore successful from a programming perfective
 as the process of development from initial design to finished product has been competed. </p>

 <h2> Development Hurdles:</h2>
	<ol>
	<p> Packaging the project: The packaging of the project into an installable and creating the necessary
	file structure and configuration was more time consuming that previously expected. </p>
	<p> Using a forked module: The use of a forked module from a git repository was required as it was the
	only version available to work with version three of python cause some problems in the packaging stages.</p>
	<p> Test modules: File hierarchy has posed a problem in implementing test modules as importing through
	the file structure has proven difficult to implement.</p>
	<p> Orginazation: The organization and reorganization of files provided some temporary set backs.</p>

 <h2> Lessons Learned:</h2>
	<ol>
	<h3>SQLAlchemy: </h3>
	<p>We have learned through the development of this project that it is necessary to use
	getter methods to access database entries followed by an update method to edit database entries.  
	Throughout the development of the webpage we learned that assessing entries via index and editing
	entries directly would provide a cleaner interface that would be easier to use and understand for 
	future developers. </p>
	<p> Example:</p>
	<p> Getting a user:</p>
	<p> db.user[1] instead of db.user.get(1)</p>
	<p> Updating a username:</p>
	<p> user.username = “Bar” instead of db.user.update(1, username = “Bar”).</p>
	<h3> Effective interface:</h3>
	<p>We learned that an effective an easy to understand interface is essential to any project especially projects where multiple individuals are using the same modules/tools.
	This is important as a poor interface can restrict a developer’s understanding and lead to confusion which can negativelyaffect the development of a project.</p>
	<h3> Modulization:</h3>
	<p> The importance of modulization was shown as throughout the project as breaking down processes into
	reusable modules and classes is very efficient and creates a more productive development process.</p>
